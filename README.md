Home page shows a list of matches. A list item contains following infromation: match opponents
names, the winners name and winning hand, what hands did the players play and the date and time of 
the match. Results are decending by date and time.

Clicking players names you can inspect their statistics. Player profile shows the total 
number of matches played, most played hand and win ratio. The profile page also contains 
a list of players own matches.
