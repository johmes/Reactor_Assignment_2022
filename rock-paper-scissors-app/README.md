# Rock Paper Scissors Match Result App

Developer Â© 2022 Johannes Mensalo

This app is created as a pre-assignment for Reaktor summer trainee 2022 job application. It is a web app developed using React.

Home page shows a list of matches. A list item contains following infromation: match opponents names, the winners name and winning hand, what hands did the players play and the date and time of the match. Results are decending by date and time.

Clicking players names you can inspect their statistics. Player profile shows the total number of matches played, most played hand and win ratio. The profile page also contains a list of players own matches.
